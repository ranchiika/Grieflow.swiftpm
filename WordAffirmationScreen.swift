        "Itâ€™s okay to feel sad, lost, or even confused. Your feelings are valid, and you donâ€™t have to hide or get rid of them right away. Give yourself time to process everything, because wounds donâ€™t heal overnight. You are not alone, and you are still worthy, even when everything feels heavy.",
        
        "Losing someone or something precious is painful, and there is no â€˜rightâ€™ way to grieve. Everyone has their own way of dealing with sadness, so donâ€™t feel pressured to be â€˜okayâ€™ too soon. You have the right to feel sad, to cry, and even to be angry. What matters most is knowing that you are not alone on this journey.",
        
        "The pain you feel today is proof of how deeply you have loved. Nothing can truly replace that loss, but every small step forward is a sign of your strength. Itâ€™s okay to feel exhausted, to take a break, but never forget that there is still light within you. And slowly, you will find peace again.",
        
        "Grieving doesnâ€™t mean forgetting. Itâ€™s a journey of learning how to love someone who is no longer here in a different way. The sense of loss may never completely disappear, but over time, it will become a part of your story that makes you stronger. Itâ€™s okay to hurt now, but believe that you will find a way to move forward.",
        
        "Some days will feel heavier than others, and thatâ€™s okay. Healing is not about erasing the pain, but about learning to carry it with love and grace. You donâ€™t have to rush or have everything figured out right now. Just take it one day at a time. You are doing the best you can, and that is enough"
